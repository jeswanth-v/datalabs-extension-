Privacy Policy for Datalabs Translator Extension
Last Updated: 25-02-20205

Datalabs Translate Extension ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle user data when using our Chrome extension.

1. Information We Collect
Our extension does not collect, store, or share any personal information. The only data we process is the text you select for translation, which is temporarily sent to the translation API to provide results.

2. How We Use the Information
The selected text is sent to our translation service only for the purpose of providing translations.
No data is stored, shared, or used for any other purpose.
3. Third-Party Services
Our extension uses a third-party translation API (Datalabs Translator) to process the selected text. This service may handle the text you send but does not store or use it beyond providing translations.

4. Data Security
We ensure that no personally identifiable information is collected, stored, or transmitted. The extension operates entirely within your browser and does not track user activity.

5. Your Choices
Since our extension does not store or track data, there is no need for additional privacy controls. If you have concerns, you can disable or remove the extension at any time.

6. Updates to This Privacy Policy
We may update this policy if needed. Changes will be reflected on this page.
